Determined to analyze a significant number of features and datasets, the five friends embark on a quest for more data. They unanimously decide to use the CMU Movie Summary Corpus, a collection of 42,306 movie plot summaries and metadata. This dataset provides information at both the movie level (including box office revenues, genres, and release dates) and the character level (including gender and estimated age). Their choice is based on the work of David Bamman, Brendan O'Connor, and Noah Smith, as presented in their paper [*Learning Latent Personas of Film Characters*]((https://aclanthology.org/P13-1147.pdf)) (ACL 2013).

Moreover, Mael, a cinematophile and a huge fan of the Oscar ceremony, returned with an Oscar dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unanimad/the-oscar-award). The dataset contains information about the movie name, release date, ceremony date, nomination category, name of the nomination, and whether or not the movie won.

On the other hand, Mathieu found a dataset containing information on 6,820 movies from 1986 to 2016, including attributes such as budget, revenue, production company, genre, director, actors, ratings, runtime, and more, providing valuable insights into the movie industry's trends over time. The dataset is available on this [GitHub](https://github.com/danielgrijalva/movie-stats).

As for Pol... He fell asleep after watching all five Pirates of the Caribbean movies, totaling 12 hours and 9 minutes. In that time, he could have found a dataset!
