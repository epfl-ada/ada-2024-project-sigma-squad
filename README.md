## Abstract

We aim to analyse the factors contributing to the long-term career success of actors in the film industry. We seek to explore what sets successful actors apart. Starting from a bottom-up approach, we will first establish a "success index" for movies based on various weighted factors, such as ratings, revenue, awards, and popularity. Once we identify the most successful movies, we will trace the actors involved and evaluate their career paths, identifying trends that may contribute to their success. We will then explore specific actor attributesâ€”such as genre specialization, age at career start, and frequency of successful rolesâ€”to determine correlations and potential predictors of sustained success. Ultimately, our goal is to offer a data-driven understanding of what makes certain actors thrive in the competitive film industry.

## Research Questions

* How can we define and calculate a "success index" for movies, and what factors should it include?
* Does an actorâ€™s age at career start, choice of genres, or frequency in high-grossing movies correlate with their career success?
* Can we use these findings to predict the likelihood of success for actors based on early-career indicators?

## Additional datasets

To enrich our analysis, we will use the following additional datasets:

* **The Oscar Award Dataset**  
  Source: [Kaggle - The Oscar Award](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unanimad/the-oscar-award)  
  This dataset provides information on Oscar nominations and wins. It includes details such as categories, winners, and nominees across multiple years. This will help us assess the impact of awards on career success.

* **TMDb Movie Dataset**  
  Source: [IMDb - Dataset](https://github.com/danielgrijalva/movie-stats)  
  This dataset contains information on 6,820 movies released from 1986 to 2016, including details on budget, production company, country, director, genre, gross revenue, name, rating, release date, runtime, IMDb score, user votes, main actor, writer, and release year.

Note on dataset choice: initially, we considered a larger dataset from [Kaggle - TMDb Data 09/20](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kakarlaramcharan/tmdb-data-0920), which contained approximately 119 000 movies with 27 features each. However, during preprocessing, we found significant data quality issues, particularly with key features like budget. For instance, some movies had a budget of "1," while others showed accurate values like "23 million," suggesting inconsistencies beyond simple unit errors; or, for some movies, a budget of "30" was listed where the actual budget was 30 million. Considering the unreliability of this dataset, we chose a smaller one that still includes the features of interest but with more accurate values, ensuring the reliability of our calculated index. Validation of these results is available in the results.ipynb notebook.

## Methods

1.**Data Assesment and Selection of Criteria**
  To ensure a reliable success index, we focused on critcal factors such as **budget**, **revenue**, **ratings**, **Oscar nominations**, and **profitability**. After assessing the CMU Movie dataset and additional sources, we found that 5'119 movies meet our criterias with sufficient data for analysis and creating a robust index.  

2.**Movie Success Index**:
   The movie success index adds four primary factors. probitability, revenue, reviews and Oscar nominations, each, scaled from 0 to 10 for comparability. The aspects of these factors are:

* **Probitability**:
      Calculated as the ratio of revenue to budget, with a log transform to reduce the effect of outliers, then normalized.
* **Revenue**:
      Scaled using a log10 to balance large and small revenue and giving a score from 0-10.
* **Oscar Score**
      Acts as a multiplier to reward movies with high acclaim, and having decayed returns for subsequent nominations.
  The final index is then weighted with 35% profitability and revenue, 30% reviews and is finally scaled from 0-10, giving us the final success index for the movies.

3.**Actor Success Analysis**:
    Based on the movies identified as successful, we will trace the actors involved and calculate each actor's "success index" based on the average success scores of their films. The index is based of a **multiplier** and **streak system** which values **consistency** and **frequency of success**.

* **Calculation of the multplier**:
Successive movies by the same actors are given a multiplier based on wether they improve or decline upon from the previous movie's score. Improvements lead to greater multipliers while drops penalizes the score. This ensures that consistent actors are more rewarded.
* **Cumulative Scoring**:
Each movie index is adjusted by the cumulative multiplier, log10-transformed and normalized to gives us a consistent 0-10 metric to comparing actors' career trajectories.

4.**Predictive Analysis**:
    Using regression models, we will analyse the correlation of various actor attributes with their career success. This approach would involve using regression models to predict an actorâ€™s success index based on features like genre diversity, frequency of high-scoring movies, age at career start, and Oscar nominations.

## Project P2 timeline

The project will span two weeks, from November 4th to November 15th. Our weekly goals are as follows:

* First week (Nov 4th to 10th): redefine the projectâ€™s problem statement and key questions, assess the projectâ€™s feasibility with the available data, and explore additional datasets for inclusion.
* Second week (Nov 11th to 15th): develop the success index by identifying key factors and determining the appropriate weighting for accurate results.

## Organization within the team

## Questions for TAs

* Are there best practices for validating weights in a composite index like ours?
